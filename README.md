The traditional business model of cruise ships is to ferry tourists between destinations.
But the trading of goods between island nations has been an untapped business venue until
now. The Cruise Ship Arbitrage App allows cruise ships to buy and sell products at steep
profit margins by taking advantage of supply and demand through geographical arbitrage.

The app allows the purser to check inventory and do onboard business transactions before
reaching the physical point of sale. In the same way, purchasing ship supplies can be
done to insure a comfortable trip for the passengers. Sales tax and currency conversions
are automatically calculated between a range of 6 carribbean currencies.
