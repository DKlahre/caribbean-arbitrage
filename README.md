<H4>The traditional business model of cruise ships is to ferry tourists between destinations. But</br>
the trading of goods between island nations has been an untapped business alternative until</br>
now. The Cruise Ship Arbitrage App allows cruise ships to buy and sell products at steep</br>
profit margins by taking advantage of supply and demand through geographical arbitrage.</br></H4>

<H4>The app allows the purser to check inventory and do onboard business transactions before</br>
reaching the physical point of sale. In the same way, purchasing ship supplies can be done</br>
to take care of the needs of the passengers. Sales tax and currency conversions are automa-</br>
tically calculated between a range of 6 carribbean currencies.</br></H4>
