Using Java Spring Boot, ReactJS and 4 MySQL databases, the Caribbean Arbitrage App 
allows cruise ships to take advantage of arbitrage trading opportunities as they 
operate through the Caribbean archipelago. It also enables a ship's purser to create 
passenger profiles, streamline booking/boarding issues and replenish supplies.
Items may be purchased and sold between each island nation through provisioning companies. 
Pricing structures and a ledger of transactions may be accessed through the control panel. 
Database search capabilities include:

    • Products by country
    • Countries by product
    • Transactions by date

Products that are offered by each island's provisioner may be added or deleted. 
Corresponding prices are translated from the US Dollar to a group of diverse currencies.

    • British Pound(£)
    • East Caribbean Dollar(EC$)
    • Euro(EUR€)
    • Barbadian Dollar(Bds$)
    • Trinidad and Tobago Dollar(TT$)
